This is the repository I created by following section 7 of Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's React Native course on Udemy.
I wrote all the code myself and tested it on both Android and iOS emulators.
It is an app that shows categories of meals. The meals in each category are then displyed in the form of a card.
Images are fetched from the web while all other info of the meal is in a local file.
Redux-toolkit is used to maintain a list of favourite meals that are displayed in a separate section.
